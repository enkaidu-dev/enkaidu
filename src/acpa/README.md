# ACP Agent

ACP, or Agent Client Protocol, defines a (hopefully) standard interface for an editor or IDO to communicate with AI agents.

> Not to be confused with the [Agent Connection Protocol](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/introduction/welcome) which is something else and is changing into the A2A framework etc.

## Highlights

- Uses JSON RPC like MCP
- Communicates over STDIO
- Launches agents as sub-processes
- Intended for use by feature applications to launch and use AI agents (e.g. Zed to use Claude Code)
