#### FEATURES

* Refactor the `Web` toolset
  - Rename the `http_get_text_tool` with the `http_get_web_page` tool and modify it to accept an optional "preserve_source" property
  - Add a `http_get_web_page_as_markdown` tool which will retrieve a web page and, based on the content type, convert HTML to markdown or wrap other text formats in a Markdown code block.
    - It will always include an `Accept` header for markdown in case the website supports that.
