#### FEATURES

- Until now Enkaidu provided one session in which you could push / pop chat sessions.
- Enkaidu now supports multiple named sessions, with the default (initial) one called `prime`
- There are three new `/session ...` sub-commands to support this:
  - create (`new`) named sessions, with the option to specify a model name, allowing different sessions to use different LLMs;
  - list (`ls`) active named sessions, which shows the model and depth of the session stack; and
  - switch (`goto`) between active sessions.
- Additionally, Enkaidu shows the current session's name as the prefix of the user input prompt. E.g. `@prime > `

#### IMPROVEMENTS

- When using a custom prompt you can now choose to hide the prompt. E.g. `/prompt use echo show=no`

#### FIXES

- Fixed a bug where the loaded toolsets map was inadvertently using a tool name as the key, which caused errors during `/session reset`

#### MISC

- Updated `README.md` with section on running Enkaidu as a container
