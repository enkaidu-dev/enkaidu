#### FEATURES

* Adds the `Web` toolset which currently contains only the `http_get_text_tool`.
  - When loaded this can be used to retrieve text content using HTTP URLs, with content reduction for HTML, JSON, and XML content.
  - This tool also allows caller to specify `Accept` content type, which is useful when dealing with sites that serve Markdown.

#### FIXES

* No longer hangs when Enkaidu is run in macOS native Terminal app (See #99)
