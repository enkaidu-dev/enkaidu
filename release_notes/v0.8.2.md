#### FEATURES

* Enkaidu adds the `Web` toolset which currently contains only the `http_get_text_tool`. When loaded this can be used to retrieve text content using HTTP URLs, with content reduction for HTML, JSON, and XML content. This tool also allows caller to specify `Accept` content type, which is useful when dealing with sites that serve Markdown.
