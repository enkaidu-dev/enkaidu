#### FEATURES

- n/a

#### IMPROVEMENTS

- Modified the `find_files` tool to better match how `find` command works, with an optional `starting_path` parameter that defaults to `"."` and the globbing pattern parameter renamed to `path_pattern` and whose requirement is enforced (with error if not specified.)

#### FIXES

- Fix `/session new TEST model=M` which doesn't report error when `M` doesn't exist
- Fix `/session push` so that it always uses parent's model, preserving model change in new root sessions.

#### MISC

- Updated some dependencies, and pinned them down to versions that don't break the build.
