This release adds support for MCP- and user-defined prompts.

* Check out the `/prompt` command and its various sub-commands: `ls`, `info`, and `use`
* MCP servers with prompts are supported
* Users can define custom prompts using templating in their config file (e.g. `enkaidu.yaml`) using the new `prompts:` section.

Check out the `README.md` for more details.
