#### FEATURES

- Add `find_files` tool, which finds files by matching a glob pattern, to the `FileManagement` toolset.
  - Sorts list by default, but can be disabled.
- Add `search_files` tool, which search files for matching pattern, to the `FileManagement` toolset.. It too can finds files by matching a glob pattern.

#### IMPROVEMENTS

- When processing `macros/`, `prompts/`, and `system_prompts/` folders within `.enkaidu/`, recurse (up to 8) sub-folders to locate YAML files. This lets us better manage related prompts while using separate files when prompts are long.
- Rename the tool for creating text files to `write_text_file` and add optional parameter to over-write the file if it exists. Also, create intermediate for the file if needed.

#### FIXES

- Fixed `/session pop_and_take` with used with `reset_parent=yes` to **only** erase the parent session's history without resetting anything else. Other aspects of the sessions (tools, prompts, system prompt, model, etc) remain unchanged.
- Fixed `write_text_tool` to ensure it can't over-write files in the `.deleted_files/` folder

#### MISC

- Refactored `src/llm` to rename `Session` with `History`, and simplify method names.
- Removed the `list_files` tool; no need with `find_files`.
