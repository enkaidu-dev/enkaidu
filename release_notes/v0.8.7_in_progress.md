> TODO: REMOVE THIS WHEN READY TO RELEASE

#### FEATURES

> N/a

#### IMPROVEMENTS

- When processing `macros/`, `prompts/`, and `system_prompts/` folders within `.enkaidu/`, recurse (up to 8) sub-folders to locate YAML files. This lets us better manage related prompts while using separate files when prompts are long.

#### FIXES

> Fixed `/session pop_and_take` with used with `reset_parent=yes` to **only** erase the parent session's history without resetting anything else. Other aspects of the sessions (tools, prompts, system prompt, model, etc) remain unchanged.

#### MISC

> Refactored `src/llm` to rename `Session` with `History`, and simplify method names.
