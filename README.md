# Enkaidu

![Enkaidu](./webui/public/favicon.png)

[Enkaidu](https://enkaidu.dev) is your _second-in-command(-line)_ for coding and creativity. Inspired by Enkidu, the loyal and dynamic companion from Mesopotamian mythology, Enkaidu embodies collaboration, adaptability, and a touch of chaos to spark innovation.

Out of the box, with the use of _your preferred_ AI large language models, Enkaidu is designed to assist you with writing & maintaining code (and other text-based content).

Additionally, by integrating with MCP servers _of your choice_, Enkaidu can help you do even more.

## Contributions, by invitation!

*With apologies*, at this time contributions are *by invitation only* and limited to people I know and see often.

These are early days for Enkaidu and I am busy with family and work.

At this time I want to work on this at a manageable pace.
